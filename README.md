# A Lox interpreter/bytecode compiler written in Rust.

Pitiful attempt at a Lox interpreter - [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

The coolest thing about this is the Pratt parsing. Otherwise, it's a good example of how *not* to implement an interpreter in Rust.

I don't know why, but I ignored the Visitor pattern and slopped together something by following the book, up until chapter 12 (classes). I would have done this in Java, but I felt like I would just end up copy/pasting code and I didn't want that.

Working on bytecode compiler.
